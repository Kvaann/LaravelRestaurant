                At the point when ‘Restaurant’ organizer Tony ventured off the<br>shorelines of Oahu following a multi-day of surfing with his Navy pals<br>in the mid-60s, he did what worked out easily for him. He went<br>hunting down a delicious burger, a hot container of fries, and a virus<br>drink.

            After twenty years, in 1982, it was that feeling of peace and fulfillment<br>he was attempting to reproduce when he took a little piece of the<br>‘Restaurant’s and thudded it down right in the territory of<br>Southern California.

            Today, ‘Restaurant’s still is consistent with Tony’s unique experience and his unique<br>vision. Also, however, our menu has developed<br>to incorporate plates of mixed greens, soups, and delicate tacos.

            Despite everything, we hold fast to the fundamental rationality that new<br>sustenance, well-disposed administration, and a laid-back air is the<br>ideal end to a hard day of work or play. We trust you taste it in each chomp.

            Furthermore, we trust that whether you’re a ravenous surfer or an<br>occupied salesman, you stroll into ‘Restaurant’ s and state to<br>yourself, as Tony did those numerous years back, “Ahh…this is the<br>place I need to be.”
